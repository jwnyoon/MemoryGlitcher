This system is a memory fragmenter to help forget the memory of someone, 
especially auditory memory that is hidden in your brain somewhere. 
It damages raw data of the voice file so that you cannot open the file anymore after you run this program several times.

What if I can manipulate my memory like a computer memory?
What do I want/need to fragment?
For me, it might be the voices of him/her called my name. 

If I assume that my memory has the same system as that of computer, there should be a folder of the voices. In this folder, there should be a file about calling my name. And once I run this memory fragmenter to the file, It would lose some of data elements and get damaged.

I made a prototype of this system using Processing. Every time user clicks the icon, more damaged voice file would be played.
If user does it too many times, Processing would show “NullPointerException Error” and the file could not be opened because the file doesn’t have enough data.

This is the final project of "To remember and Forget: Memory and Machine" class at ITP NYU 2014.
I referred Kyle McDonald's [RawEdit example](https://github.com/ITPNYU/Glitch/tree/master/RawEdit) to manipulate Hexdata. 

Technology: Processing
